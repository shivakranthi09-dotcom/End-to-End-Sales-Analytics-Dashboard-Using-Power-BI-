End-to-End Sales Analytics Dashboard Using Power BI (Amazon Dataset) 
 
I used a sample Amazon sales dataset that contains columns such as Order ID, Ship Date, 
Customer Name, Country, State, Region, City, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name, Sales, 
Quantity, Discount, and Profit. Based on these fields, I created an interactive Power BI report to 
analyse overall sales performance and customer behaviour. 
The visuals clearly present key insights such as: 
• Total Sales and Total Profit shown through card visualizations. 
• Top 5 Products and Top 5 Customers by Sales displayed using stacked bar charts. 
• Sales Distribution by Region, represented using a pie chart. 
• Sum of Profit by Region, displayed using a donut chart for better comparison. 
• Sales Trend by State, shown through a line chart indicating an increasing pattern. 
• Time-based Sales Insights (Year, Quarter, Month, Day) using a drill-down stacked column 
chart. 
• A Profit Comparison by Product Name, highlighting the lowest bottom 5 and highest top 
5 profit-generating products using column charts. 
Overall, the report provides a clear and comprehensive view of sales, profit trends, customer 
contribution, and product-level performance across different time periods and regions.
